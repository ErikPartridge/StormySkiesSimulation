		I'm glad you've decided to learn more about TakeoffSim and I. For simplicity, I've divided the page into two sections. Enjoy!

			<h2>TakeoffSim</h2>
			<h4>The Past</h4>
			<p>TakeoffSim originally started as a desktop application written in Java, in the fall of 2013.
			It has gone through numerous, rather uncreative titles such as "Airline-Business-Simulation" over its roughly 10 months as a Java desktop application, that was never quite done (I'm sure other programmers know the feeling.)
			In June of 2014, what was then StormySkiesSim was re-branded TakeoffSim, and I changed the language to PHP, with a MySQL component, and started building the website.
			The very first version of TakeoffSim was very 2008-esque, and was temporarily released on August 5th, 2013. It was taken down less than a week later for development.
			TakeoffSim then went through another month of development, before being released. For the most part, with some improvements, that is the site you see today.</p> 
			<h4>The Present</h4>
			<p>I'm still working on it! That and it looks like, well, this.</p>
			<h4>The Future</h4>
			<p>I love working on TakeoffSim, and I love hearing from the community. I'll continue to update the website and create new great features to add on to the existing core, which features I add are 
			largely influenced by the community. If you are interested in sharing an idea, suggestion, critique, anything (which you surrender all rights to), please <a href="mailto:admin@takeoffsim.com">email me.</a> Better yet, post
			on the <a href="http://forums.takeoffsim.com">forums</a> for all to read and critique.</p>

	    	<h2>Erik Malmstrom-Partridge</h2>
	    	<h4>Who I am</h4>
	    	<p>I'm Erik Malmstrom-Partridge, a web designer, Java programmer, avid airline geek, and travel aficionado. 
	    	I'm based in Michigan, USA, and I speak both French and English fluently. But enough with credentials, this isn't a job interview.
	    	I love programming (probably a little too much), and I spend a bunch of my time doing that for reasons that elude me from time to time. A completely random tidbit about me is I love European history. I don't know why. I'm sure I'll find out someday.
	    	<h4>Why did I make TakeoffSim</h4>
	    	<p>Now that's simple. It's fun, I love airplanes, and I wanted to practice web development.</p>

	    	<h2>I lied. Three sections, here's the roll of credits</h2>
	    	<p>I use <a href="http://mjdugan.com/hosting">mjdugan.com for hosting</a></p>
	    	<p>Much, but not all of the airport data is from <a href="http://theairlineproject.com">The Airline Project</a> and released under the GPL v2.0</p>
