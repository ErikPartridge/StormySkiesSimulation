	<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
	<p>Here at TakeoffSim.com, I'm committed to making sure you understand your rights, being forthcoming with the community, and simply being simple. So as follows, here's what we do regarding your privacy:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We use Piwik for web analytics- meaning that we don't share where you go on our site, or where you come to this site from with others. That data is held on our servers, and is used for TakeoffSim.com purposes only, and will not be shared with any third party.</li>
		<li>All your data provided to this site is not shared with any third parties without your permission, except for purposes of billing (Stripe) or social network referrals (Facebook, Twitter, etc.).</li>
		<li>Credit card information is securely transmitted to Stripe for payment processing. Your credit card number is not stored on our servers, instead we store a unique identifier that allows us to tell Stripe to use that credit card for the next payment.</li>
		<li>All other data we collect (such as browser) will be stored soley on our servers, and not shared with any third party without your permission.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Any updates to this policy will be sent out via email, and given 14 days notice before any change becomes official. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions, comments, or concerns at erikdevelopments at gmail.com</p>
